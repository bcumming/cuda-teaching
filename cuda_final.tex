    \begin{info}{Is this so hard?}
        Each topic so far has not been too complicated:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item moving memory between host and device
            \item writing kernels
            \item parallel kernel launching
            \item ... ok, concurrency is hard (but concurrency is hard on the CPU too)
        \end{itemize}
        However, there is a lot that you have to keep in mind:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item where is my data?
            \item loop free thinking: individual work items to be performed in parallel
            \item synchronization between threads, host and device?
        \end{itemize}
        Combined this makes GPU programming tough to start with.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OpenMP and OpenACC attempt to make things ``easy'', but they still have shortcomings
        \end{itemize}
    \end{info}

    \begin{info}{What next?}
        You have seen some features of CUDA
        \begin{itemize}
            \item not an exhaustive overview!
            \item there are some ``essential'' features that weren't covered
        \end{itemize}
        And more importantly, I hope that you have started to think about parallel work items
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a different perspective than thinking in loops
            \item an important skill for more than just GPU programming
        \end{itemize}
    \end{info}
