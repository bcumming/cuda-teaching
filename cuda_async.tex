\begin{frame}[fragile]{Asynchronouse execution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Explain that tasks can be launched asynchronously

    benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item host can continue work while GPU works
        \item multiple tasks can be run on GPU simultaneously
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Asynchronouse execution}

    \begin{columns}[T]
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{codecolumn}{host : launch work}
%..................................
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=boxcudatiny]
kernel_1<<<...>>>(...);
kernel_2<<<...>>>(...);
host_1(...);
host_2(...);
        \end{lstlisting}
%..................................
            \end{codecolumn}
        The host:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item launches the two CUDA kernels
            \item then executes host calls sequentially 
        \end{itemize}
        The GPU:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item executes asynchronously to host
            \item executes kernels sequentially
        \end{itemize}
        \end{column}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{CUDA Asynchronous support}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    CUDA provides mechansims that facilitate asynchronous work

    \begin{itemize}
        \item streams for running tasks/data transfers
        \item events let you synchronize and query the status of execution
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Streams}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    CUDA allows us to create streams

    All kernels in a stream are serialized

    kernels in different streams can run concurrently
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if there are resources available
    \end{itemize}

    By default, all kernels and memory transfers use the default stream
    i.e. by default kernels are serialized on the device
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Streams : rule of thumb}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Ideally you don't want to use streams to fill the device with work.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a sign that you don't have enough work to start with
        \item not a hard and fast rule
        \item good for ``filling in'' between kernel executions
    \end{itemize}

    Streams come into their own for overlapping communication and computation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item because you can transfer data full speed both directions when kernels are executing on the GPU
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Events}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    CUDA provides events
    \begin{itemize}
        \item synchronize tasks in different streams:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item don't start work in stream A until stream B has finished.
            \item wait until required data has finished copy from host before launching kernel
        \end{itemize}
        \item allow us to query status of concurrent tasks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item has kernel finished/started yet?
            \item how long did a kernel take to compute?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exercises}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item time to visit \lst{util.h} and add helpers for asynchronous copy
        \item just give the event and stream wrappers ``as is''
        \begin{itemize}
            \item walk through their use in the memcpy example
        \end{itemize}
        \item fire up nvprof
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Asynchronous example: streaming}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Streaming is a workload where we can break data and work into chunks
    \begin{itemize}
        \item work on one chunk of data while the next chunk is being sent
        \item send each chunk back to host and take next available chunk of work
        \item there has to be enough work in each chunk to hide ...
    \end{itemize}

    Take, for example our axpy example...
    \begin{itemize}
        \item clearly no amount of overlap will help us
        \item note that we get full speed both directions
    \end{itemize}
