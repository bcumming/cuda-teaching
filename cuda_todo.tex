\begin{frame}[fragile]{Intermezzo: is this so hard?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{info}{}
        Each topic so far has not been too complicated:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item moving memory between host and device
            \item writing kernels
            \item parallel kernel launching
        \end{itemize}
        However, there is a lot that you have to keep in mind
        \begin{itemize}
            \item where is my data?
            \item thinking in kernels
            \item synchronization between threads, host/device?
        \end{itemize}
        Combined this makes GPU programming tough to start with.
        It would be nice to have a high-level approach, but this is an open question
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I don't think that OpenACC and OpenMP are the answer
        \end{itemize}
    \end{info}
